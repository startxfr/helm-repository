          <h2>Puprose of the demo</h2> 
          <p>
            The puprose of this demo is to explain and demonstrate the use of YAML file and resources in a 
            Kubernetes environment. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            Build around basic YAML file, this demo will show how you can change the state of a 
            resource by changing the content of it description in a YAML format.
          </p> 
          <h2>Opening this demo</h2> 
          <p>
            You must use the <a href="https://sxcm.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">sxcm cluster manager</a> 
            to deploy this demo into an appropriate openshift cluster. This demo should be opened by running 
            <code><b>$</b> sxcm demo enable yaml</code>
          </p>
          <h2>Workflow of this demo</h2> 
          <p>
            You must use the <a href="https://sxcm.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">sxcm cluster manager</a> 
            to deploy this demo into an appropriate openshift cluster. This demo should be prepared by running

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
              The first step of this demo is to observe how data could be stored into kubernetes configMap. This
              demo use the yaml representation of a object to illustrate how to record change into the K8S API.
              To run this step, you can execute the following command and follow the instructions :
            </p>
              <code>
              <b>$</b> sxcm demo run yaml step 1
              </code> 
          </li> 
           <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
              The second step of this demo is to observe how data could be changed into kubernetes configMap and how 
              change are propagated (or not imediatly) to the underlying resources (like pods).
              To run this step, you can execute the following command and follow the instructions :
            </p>
              <code>
              <b>$</b> sxcm demo run yaml step 2
              </code> 
          </li> 
           <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
              The third step of this demo is to observe how we can edit a resource and have a direct impact on it state
              To run this step, you can execute the following command and follow the instructions :
            </p>
              <code>
              <b>$</b> sxcm demo run yaml step 3
              </code> 
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
              The fourth step of this demo is to observe how we can export the state of various resource, keep track of
              if state and apply change in a gitops way of working,
              To run this step, you can execute the following command and follow the instructions :
            </p>
              <code>
              <b>$</b> sxcm demo run yaml step 4
              </code> 
          </li> 
          </ol> 
          <h2>Closing this demo</h2> 
          <p>
            This demo should be closed by running 
            <code><b>$</b> sxcm demo disable yaml</code>
          </p>
