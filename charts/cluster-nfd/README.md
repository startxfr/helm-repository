# ![cluster-nfd](https://helm-repository.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/cluster-nfd.svg "Cluster Chart : NFD") Cluster Chart : NFD
[![Artifacthub](https://img.shields.io/badge/ArtifactHub-STARTX_cluster--nfd-8A2BE2.svg)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=cluster+nfd+startx)

This helm chart is used to deploy Node Feature Discovery handled by an operator for discovery of hardware profile and feature and Label nodes with a representation of theses features.

This chart is part of the [cluster-xxx startx helm chart series](https://helm-repository.readthedocs.io#cluster-helm-charts) that doesn't necessarily deploy pods but rather represent a cluster configuration state orchestrated by gitops tools like ArgoCD.

## Requirements and guidelines

Read the [startx helm-repository homepage](https://helm-repository.readthedocs.io) for
more information on how to use theses resources.
